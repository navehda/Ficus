- To run the project locally, clone this repository and run `npm install` to install dependencies.

The additional pages I've created are the following:
1. Single product page 
2. User Profile
3. Wishlist
4. Contact Us

I found it diffucult to create the cart part, and in particular saving the new cart data so that it is saved correctly in the /data/cart.json file.
Also, it was challenging to apply global changes that affects all pages after the pages were implenented and mainiting consisticy, for example when editing the header menu.

I submit this project by myself.
